Automated E-commerce Data Pipeline: A robust, cloud-based ETL system for streamlined data analytics in e-commerce, utilizing Python, SQL, AWS, Airflow, and Docker.

This repository hosts the E-commerce Data Pipeline project, an end-to-end automated system designed for efficient handling of e-commerce data analytics. The project involves creating an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that extracts data from various e-commerce platforms, transforms it for consistency and analysis-readiness, and loads it into a data warehouse for insightful analytics.

Key Features:

- Automated data extraction from multiple e-commerce platforms.
- Data transformation and cleansing using Python and SQL.
- Data loading into Amazon Redshift for efficient storage and querying.
- Scheduling and orchestration of the ETL process with Apache Airflow.
- Implementation of monitoring solutions using AWS CloudWatch.
- Comprehensive documentation of processes, data models, and architectural decisions.
- Containerization using Docker for consistent deployment and scalability.
- Integration of CI/CD practices for streamlined development and deployment.

Technologies Used:

- Programming Languages: Python, SQL
- Cloud Platform: AWS (Lambda, Redshift, CloudWatch)
- Workflow Automation: Apache Airflow
- Containerization: Docker
- Version Control and CI/CD: Git, GitHub Actions

Project Goals:

- To demonstrate the ability to manage and automate large-scale data operations.
- To provide valuable business insights through efficient data analytics.
- To showcase best practices in data engineering and cloud-based architecture.

This project aligns with contemporary needs in data engineering, focusing on scalability, efficiency, and actionable business insights. It is designed as a model for handling complex data workflows in an e-commerce context, emphasizing automation, reliability, and clarity.
